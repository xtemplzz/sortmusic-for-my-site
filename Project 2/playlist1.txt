[Rosenrot]
A lass saw a little rose there
It was blossoming there in the light hights
Thus she addressed her beloved one
Whether he was able to climb to pick it for her
She wants it and it's great like this
It was like this and always will be
She wants it and that's the custom
She will also get what she wants 
One has to dig deep wells
If one wants to get clear water
Rosy red oh rosy red
Deep waters don't run still*
The lad is climbing the mountain in pain
He isn't interested in the view at all
He has only the little rose on his mind
He'll carry it to his sweetheart
She wants it and it's great like this
It was like this and always will be
She wants it and that's the custom
She will also get what she wants
One has to dig deep wells
If one wants to get clear water
Rosy red oh rosy red
Deep waters don't run still
A stone is breaking at his boots 
It doesn't want to stay at the rock 
And a scream announces to anyone that 
Both are falling into the abyss  
She wants it and it's great like this 
It was like this and always will be 
She wants it and that's the custom 
She will also get what she wants
One has to dig deep wells 
If one wants to get clear water 
Rosy red oh rosy red  
Deep waters don't run still

You (You have, you have, you have, you have)
Have cried a lot (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Separated in spirit (Separated, separated, separated, separated)
United in heart (United, united, united, united)
We (We are, we are, we are, we are)
Have been together for so long (You are, you are, you are, you are)
Your breath's cold (So cold, so cold, so cold, so cold)
The heart in flames (So hot, so hot, so hot, so hot)
You (You can, you can, you can, you can)
I (I know, I know, I know, I know)
We (We are, we are, we are, we are)
You (You stay, you stay, you stay, you stay)
Germany – my heart in flames
Want to love and damn you
Germany – your breath's cold
So young, and yet so old
Germany!
I (You have, you have, you have, you have)
I never want to leave you (You cry, you cry, you cry, you cry)
One can love you (You love, you love, you love, you love)
And want to hate you (You hate, you hate, you hate, you hate)
Presumptuous, superior
Take over, hand over/puke
Surprise, invade
Germany, Germany above everything
Germany – my heart in flames
Want to love and damn you
Germany – your breath is cold
So young, and yet so old
Germany – your love
Is a curse and a blessing
Germany – my love
I can't give you
Germany!
Germany!
You

We
All of you
You (superior/overpowering, unnecessary)
I (Übermenschen weary)
We (The higher you climb, the further you fall)
You (Germany, Germany above everything)

Want to love and damn you
Germany – my breath's cold
So young, and yet so old
Germany – your love
Is a curse and blessing
Germany – my love
I can't give you

[Mein herz brennt]
Now, dear children, pay attention
I am the voice from the pillow
I brought you something
Have ripped it out of my chest
With this heart, I have the power
Blackmail the eyelids
I sing until the new day comes
A bright light in the heaven's sky
My heart burns
They come to you at night
Demons, ghosts and black elves
They crawl up from the cellar rows
And will take a look under your blanket
Little children listen now
I am the voice from the pillow
I brought something to you
A bright light in the heaven's sky
My heart burns
My heart burns
They come to you at night
And steal your small hot tears
They wait till the moon awakes
And push them in my cold veins
Little children listen now
I am the voice from the pillow
I sing 'til the day awakes
A bright light in the heaven's sky
My heart burns
My heart burns
My heart burns
My heart burns
With this heart I have the power
To blackmail the eyelids
I sing 'til the day wakes up
A bright light in the heaven's sky
My heart burns
My heart burns
My heart burns (My heart)
My heart burns
(My heart burns)
(My heart burns)

[Haifisch]
We hold together,
We stand each other,
We hold to each other;
no one is going to stop us. 
We keep faith with you,
we hold to that
and adhere to the rules,
if they leave us rules.
And the shark, it has teardrops
And they run down its face,
but the shark is living in water -
so the teardrops one doesn't see. 
We keep the pace,
we keep our word;
if someone doesn't keep up,
then we'll stop immediately. 
We keep our eyes open,
we hold each other's arm;
six hearts that are burning -
the fire is keeping you warm 
And the shark, it has teardrops
And they run down its face,
but the shark is living in water -
so the teardrops one doesn't see. 
You're lonely in the depth
and some tear is flowing
and that's why the water
in the seas is salty. 
You can think of us
whatever you want;
we'll take advantage,
we never keep still. 
And the shark, it has teardrops
And they run down its face,
but the shark is living in water -
so the teardrops one doesn't see. 
You're lonely in the depth
and some tear is flowing
and that's why the water

And the shark, it has teardrops
And they run down its face,
but the shark is living in water -
so the teardrops one doesn't see.

[Ich Will]
I am a king, I am a star
I am the fire, I am there again (2x) 
I am immortal, I am never silent,
I am eternal, I am everything I want 
I am everything I want (2x) 
Everything I want, everything, everything I want
I am everything I want, everything, everything I want (2x) 
Everything I want (4x)
I am the sun, I am the light 
I am Satan, I am your face 
I am your heartbeat, I flow through your veins
Everything, simply everything, I am everything I want 
Everything I want, everything, everything I want
I am everything I want, everything, everything I want (2x) 
I am there
Everything I want, everything, everything I want
I am everything I want, everything, everything I want (2x)
I am there

[Keine lust]
I have no desire
I have no desire
I have no desire
I have no desire 
I have no desire not to hate myself
Have no desire to touch myself
I would have the desire to masturbate
Have no desire to make the effort*
I would have the desire to undress
Have no desire to see myself naked
I would have the desire to be with big animals [or, fall in love??]**
Have no desire to risk it
Have no desire to get out of the snow
Have no desire to freeze 
I have no desire
I have no desire
I have no desire
No, I have no desire
I have no desire to chew anything
Because I have no desire to digest it
Have no desire to weigh myself
Have no desire to stay fat 
I would have the desire to be with big animals
Have no desire to risk it
Have no desire to get out of the snow
Have no desire to freeze 
I will simply lie here
And again I count the flies
Listlessly, I touch myself
And suddenly realise, I've been frigid for a long time ***
So cold, I'm cold
So cold
I'm cold... 
I have no desire

[Du hast]
You need the feeling of being free
Nobody says to capture yourself
But it has been a total and sheer love
Sometimes, i ask myself
Why you? 
You have lied to me 1000 times
You have offended me 1000 times
I have flown with you so high
But, the sky was occupied
You were the wind in my feel
I was frequently thinking about you
I would do it again
With you
Tonight
I am looking for your hand, i am looking for you
Sometimes, at night, i miss you
Who takes me in his arms like you do
Whom am i telling then, my dream? 
You have lied to me 1000 times
You have offended me 1000 times
I have flown with you so high
But, the sky was occupied
You were the wind in my feel
I was frequently thinking about you
I would do it again
With you
Tonight 
Where are you, when i dream about you
Where are you when i secretly cry 
You have lied to me 1000 times
You have offended me 1000 times
I have flown with you so high
But, the sky was occupied
You were the wind in my feel
I was frequently thinking about you
I would do it again
With you
Tonight

[Mutter]
Mother, oh mother
Mother, oh mother
Mother, oh mother
The man with the cokes is there 
It was once called the black gold of the Ruhr,
It gave warmth, comfort and energy
In a special chemical process
volatilized from the original matter the gases
Coal becomes cokes
The people longed for the energy,
which the cokes provided them
But it was too expensive for the people
Mother, oh mother, the man with the cokes is there!
Mother, the man with the cokes is there
Yes, my boy, yes, I know that
Mother, the man with the cokes is there
Yes, my boy, yes, I know that
I don't have money and you don't have money,
Who has ordered the man with the cokes?
I don't have money and you don't have money,
Who has ordered the man with the cokes?
The black gold has become white
One takes a simple recipe
And cokes became coal again
Warmth, comfort, energy ...
Warmth, comfort, energy ...
Mother, oh mother, the man with the cokes is there 
Mother, the man with the cokes is there

[Gangstar's Paradise]
Yeah! Mmmmhhhhmmmmm!
Just a minute and I can tell you
about the things that don't need to be.
Here we are at the place where it all began,
people can’t you see
Thought you knew about the west side,
east side Gs on the creep and go
Only living for the day,
never worried about tomorrow.
Always tripping, now we're slipping,
ladies bitching, babies missing
From the evils of the world 
They been spending most their lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
We keep spending most of our lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm 
Power and a-money, money is the power,
ain’t a damn thing funny,
this is a jack, fool, so don't you holler
Cause I don’t have that long and I know that it's wrong,
but I live by the G’s rules and it’s on
So don’t you trip, 'cause I won’t slip, I keep my
Gs by my side and my thing on my hip
So don’t you creep by my 'hood without your heat
or it’s the grim reaper that you’re sure to meet 
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me 
They been spending most their lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
We keep spending most of our lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Now here’s another that comes to mind,
'bout a sister that put herself in a bind
She keeps praying on the day
that her man would come home from prison to stay.
The life she’s living
The love she’s giving
The pain is killing
The stress she’s feeling
From the evils of the world.
They been spending most their lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
We keep spending most of our lives
living in the gangsta's paradise
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Eh ohm ah eh ohm ohm ohm
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise
Ain’t no gangstas living in paradise

[Too Hot]
Boy me a' fie go leave that town
here ya know 'cause it's too hot 
Too hot, this town is too hot
now they're calling for their guns
about to spoil the rude boys' fun
but rude boys never give up their guns 
It's too hot 
No man can tell them what to do
pound for pound, they say they're ruder than you
they are the boss, and no back down
you might have a couple you like 
Choose your burial sight
take insurance, make up your will
come out and tell them, find them 
The soldiers came back to you without them
the police force are afraid, they can't even touch them
they say "You think you're bad? Why don't you come out yourself"
These boys are calling for a fight, fighting tonight, they don't lie 
It's too hot 
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot
Too hot, too hot

[Do You See]
If I turn around
And walked away
Would you notice that I'm gone?
Would you even care? 
Would you look at me?
Do you see the smile on my face?
Or do you see the tears I fight to hold inside?
Look at me, I'm gone... 
How could I let you
Follow blindly your path?
I kept your memory close to my heart
And when you took your sorrow
And left without a trace
I searched for every stone
I searched in all the world 
My heart so empty,
My soul that breaks inside,
My withered hands are folded throughout. 
Here I am
Still longing for you
Still empty and alone.... 
My heart so empty,
My soul that breaks inside,
My withered hands are folded throughout.

[Mockingbird]
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
To wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill
Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
You're as welcome as the flowers
On Mockingbird Hill
When the sun in the morning peeps over the hill
And kisses the roses 'round my window sill
Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the trill
Of the birds in the treetops on Mockingbird Hill 
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
You wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill
Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
You're as welcome as the flowers
On Mockingbird Hill 
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
You wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill
Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, tweedle dee dee
You're as welcome as the flowers
On Mockingbird Hill

[Shake That]
Shady
Aftermath
(Look at that bitch, shit, hey!)
There she go
Shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget the ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered, puke drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated, till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good, pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall, with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We about to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up
Now, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it, swallow it and now finish
Yeah!
Me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we (finna, finna have a)
We about have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded (man I told ya!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
Now, look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Now, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin it up
There she go
Shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
I ain't leaving without you, bitch!
You're comin' home with me
And my boy
And his boy
And his boy
And his girl
Haha, Nate Dogg!

[Superman]
Mhmm
You high baby?
Yeah
Yeah? (Hahaha)
Talk to me
You want me to tell you somethin'?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear
'Cause I know you want me, baby
I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby)
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl
Come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on…

[Sing For The Moment]
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his f- dad walking out
'Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the f- did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim, but I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody coulda seen this shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me
The minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"

Bury my face in comic books, 'cuz I don't wanna look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylonol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I prolly should 'cuz these problems are piled all at once
'Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cuz I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cuz I hate him so bad
Worst fear that I had was growing up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"

I don't wanna quit this shit, i feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame in real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never would've rapped
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein' a no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had instead
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

When I'm gone for good

[The Way I Am]
Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am, huh
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience
Has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause...
I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[No Regrets]
Tell me a story
Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not estranged
I didn't lose my mind it was
Mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away...
No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
Sing me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine
I know from the outside
(Some people said)
We looked good for eachother
Felt things were going wrong
When you didn't like my mother
I don't want to hate
But that's all you've left me with
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy
Of how we all could live
No regrets they don't work
No regrets now, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
I know they're still talking
(You're far too short to carry weight)
The demons in your head
(Return the videos they're late)
If I could just stop hating you
(Goodbye)
I'd feel sorry for us instead
Remember the photographs insane
The ones where we all laugh so lame
We were having the time of our lives
Well thank you, it was a real blast
No regrets, they don't work
No regrets, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
Write me a love song
(You're far too short to carry weight)
Drop me a line
(Return the videos they're late)
Suppose it's just a point of view
(Goodbye)
But they tell me I'm doing fine
Everything I wanted to be
Everytime I walked away
Everytime you told me to leave
I just wanted to stay
Everytime you looked at me
And everytime you smiled
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
I loved the way we used to laugh
I loved the way we used to smile
Often I sit down and think of you for a while
And then it passes me by
And I think of someone else instead
I guess the love we once had
Is officially
Dead!

[Kamikaze]
Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year, Fack, last year can eat a dick)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G, Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You-you collaborative effort rap
I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart
You didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to
Smash into everyone
Crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone
Crash like an F-15
Damage already done
Y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold like Snake Eyes
Twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to
Smash into everyone
Crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone
Crash like an F-15
Damage already done
Y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Take a loook at what I've done
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass
It's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serial killin' every beat there is, but wait
Wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is a foot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?)
Twelve inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G, Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

[Just Lose It]
OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything
But little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby aah aah, oh baby baby aah aah
It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party
All the way to Sunday, maybe 'till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby aah aah, oh baby baby aah aah
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up,
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said save it boy, we got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls,
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl girl girl (now you know you're my world)
Alright now lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby aah aah, oh baby baby aah aah
Mm touch my body
Mm touch my body
Ooh boy just touch my body
I mean girl just touch my body

[Lucky You]
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I, run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno
Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto, and all of you culo
They debated the level, I've been to ghetto to ghetto
Looking for something I prolly could never find now
Shit get real up until the beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone, and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say "What a wonderful feeling!"
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Leaving Heaven]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)
Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, "Fuck it"
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
A God but a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say "I hate you" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, "Thank you")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)

[The Ringer]
Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts
And see where this takes me
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause
I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil' Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a Sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll just turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us?" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'Zae
Lil' Pump, Lil' Xan imitate Lil' Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do when you run into?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange, oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date, " "Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple!" "No it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch (yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

[Killshot]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuck, your beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
We doin' this once
Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (Slim you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you
'Til I'm hitting old age, still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write, "Not Alike"
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it) - 
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it
You fuckin', oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love you

[You Don't Know]
Shady... Yeah.!!
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know...

Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'Cause I want you to triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit

I tear the club up fo' sho...
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but actin' like you don't know
When me and fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out (whoooo!)
When it's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it
It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr... Ferrari
So it's shady after-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come izzon what kinda fizz-uckin' question is that
Who run it?
You know, you actin' like you don't know...

And you know but actin' like you don't know...
Who run it?
You know, you actin' like you don't know...
I tear the club up fo' sho...
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but actin' like you don't know... {cashis, break it down now!}
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me
Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine
Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fkin' g
I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it
We run it! You know, you actin' like you don't know...
I tear the club up fo' sho...
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but you actin' like you don't know...
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know...

And you know but you actin' like you don't know...

You know what this is
Shady. G-unit. Aftermath
Lloyd banks... Cashis... Marshall Mathers... Ferrari F-50...
Its a movement. You can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo...
Go...

[Kill You]
When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma!?
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen' in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
(Ah-haha)
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I've been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ask to rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend?
No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again
Then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the 10th
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
But that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in
Or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you
You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
(Ah-haha)
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that
I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From that fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I got the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said, shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me
Or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you
You don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
(Ah-haha)
I said you don't
Wanna fuck with Shady
(Why not?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
Hahaha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you

[Those Kinda Nights]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights
Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up back in the cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the motel, ayy
Yeah, Bizzare's tryna get a lapdance
Off a Xan next to Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like, goddamn
She's like, that's harassment, I'm like, yeah, and? (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, fuck off and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em
I said, oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said, "No, I'm bi"
She said, "Are you drunk?, " I said, "No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick, " she said, "So am I"
What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?
She said, cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back
Then I said
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Says she wants to go with me
I said, "Go with you where?" She said, "Out"
I said, "I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me"
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes the brigade
Turn like a flip page, 50 look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, "Let's pull over, " she said, "No problemo"
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

[I Will]
And I don't think that I can stop it, here it comes
I do my best to try to block it, redrum
I've been sipping on like, vodka, head's numb
I'm blacking out, you better watch it, it's bedlam
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start takin' off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Farrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, a bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real truth, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"
Yeah, Slaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ay, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks wanna rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
The nigga gotta send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor, with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (pew)
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"
Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, "Motherfuck school" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime, I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, "What the heck was that?"
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, "Protect your neck"
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image I have zero time or regard for
A never was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic, newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"
And I don't think that I can stop it, here it comes
I do my best to try to block it, redrum
I've been sipping on like, vodka, head's numb
I'm blacking out, you better watch it, it's bedlam

[So Bad]
Yeah,
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
Yeah, I feel it too
Damn
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
Ha ha
I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling
I'm right back on 'em, with the
I can't call it
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Now, it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
To appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!
I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

[Under The Influence]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets, ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady

[Berzerk]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad 'cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
Dumb it down, I don't know how (huh-huh) how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) get your vials
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) get your vials
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) get your vials

[Cold Wind Blows]
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name, so on the biggest stage
They came to see you spit your game, oh oooh
But it shouldn't be difficult
To explain just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice he remain, Fuck em all
Tell em all eat shit
Here we go again
Oh, God Damn
Is it that time again already?
Ok
Ya'll don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man
Don't everybody welcome me back at once

Motherfucker might as well let
My lips pucker, like Elton John
'Cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on
Cuz you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on
Everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddha, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banners back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks
I'm the only goose standing
I'll set the world on fire
Piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle
But I'm not fucking around
Motherfucker
I saw you pussy footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
Till it makes her queef
And sounds like a fucking
Whoopie cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You must have mistook me for
Some sissy soft punk
Looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fucking hater, push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot
Cuz I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy G's up
All you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down
Shady ease up, Man chill
Nah, I can't god damnit
Rap is a land fill
Drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens
The world will stop spinning
And Michael J Fox
Will come to a stand still
During a earthquake
Urine in your face
Cuz your fake
Aahh, what the fuck, that hurt wait
Aahh, what the fuck
I just got struck by lightning
I write, then I quit
God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent but I warn you
If you continue, to hell I send you
And just then the wind blew
And I said
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-
How long will I be this way?
Shady, until my dying day
Until I hang up the mic
And it's time for me to say
So long till then I drop the
Fucking bombs like I missed
The pass when I went long
If you don't like it
You can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along
Slut this, slut that
Learn the words to the song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and
The Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So don't compare me to
Them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges
Peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas
Pussy cut off the grapes
And grow a pair, but I swear
You try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything
Like everyone does
We're auto-tuned
The last thing you want to do
Is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing
This and I thought of you so
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man I just don't know no no no no no no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Bl- bl- blows, Bl- blow blows oh oh o-
I don't know
I don't know what caused
I don't know
What caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably
Be this way until my dying day
I don't know why I'm so
I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

[Little Engine]
I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in
Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (Yeah)
Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (Nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (Yeah)
Propane takin' my cranium
Code-name Titanium Temper
I almost swallowed my car
I call my Mercedes a Benzo
Bitch, I ball like a baby
Ball like J, but not Jay as in
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
'Cause I got a huge mansion
No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I'm still the one your parents hate
I'm in your house eatin' carrot-cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin'
Straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Raise the concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it's a staircase
Now, little engine gone, finna vrin-vrin gone
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine
I am the top-sellin', who cares?
Stop dwellin', then stop yellin'
I'm not yellin', you're yellin'
Smart aleck, goddammit
Fuck is that? Stop hammering (God)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics will get slain
Life it will strangle you with bicycle chain
You're gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a red tie (Yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in, edgewise (Shut up)
Success overnight like a red eye (Bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy from the Westside
I'm hot dog, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, Marshall, on fire
I looked down and said, no, I'm not, you're a liar
She said, no, your music
Heard you're back with the Dr. and I heard
Now, little engine gone, finna vrin-vrin gone
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo

In my left hand, I hold mic stand
Little engine gone
Chicka-ch-chill like I z-z-zero, zero, zip, zip, zilch (Yeah)
Like Kaepernick, I got kn-kn-kneel (Nil), word to Goodwill-will
This must be how bein' hoodrich feels
Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill (Hi hoe)
Finna take you out like an outro
Bruce Wayne and Alfred, look out hoe
Blueface meets Albert DeSalvo
Balboa with a scalpel
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo
Now, little engine gone, finna vrin-vrin gone
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick-Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine, gone

[Hailie's Song]
Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no)
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me
Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you

[W.T.P]
Yeah, oh!
Get up, I said get up
Let's go!
Better watch out, now, here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone
Now first of all I'm the boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him, if you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right up off her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up! Dance!
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks if there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from "Night of the Livin' Dead"
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed
Till I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa"
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's from the north, east and west
But when it comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, 'cause homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, c'mon
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks if there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party
Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good, get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
'Cause girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S, L to the I, M to the S, H, A, D, Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown, I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to unthaw, you feel me, y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up!
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks if there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party
(White Trash Party)

[Unaccommodating]
Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
Amen
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mill' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect your life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox, you're gonna need three SWATs
A police officer's at least cuffing me up for evading and I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars
I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it
And I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God
And the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy
They call me Kanye crazy
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z
And I'm back with Andre, baby
And the doctor's operating
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop kid out to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect
I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet
Now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickle-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say abracadabra and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving me, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[8 Mile]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
And go follow the footsteps I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work, I go back to this 8 Mile Road


You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
I'm torn in my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Cinderella Man]
Yeah
You know, technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it
Might as well make the most of it
Yeah
Feels good, woo
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowing this one
Nah, man
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now
Who can catch lighting in a bottle? Set fire to water?
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose? Flyer than swatters?
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I'll be God-damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause your flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva, what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like "woo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, 'how bout you?
Now guess who (hey)
Here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (hey)
Now, what's his name (hey)

Screamed "shut up" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

Cinderella man Cinder-fella Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell, from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story, nor did he
Come to do the same old, can't afford to be a lame-o in this day and age
And at this stage of the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new que sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de grace, raise 'em high in the sky
Keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient I will make no more mistakes, shit my
Potatoes baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed, yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin' image, I mirror it
When I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too

[You Gon Learn]
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks
Some things are just meant to be
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation
Then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segragation, that's funny bro
The segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
Never sold dope, from the gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head
I got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping "Fuck Da Police" while I'm federales
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn

[Crack a Bottle]
Uh.
Oh, adies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us.
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us.
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move, " a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us.
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk.

[Satalitte]
I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Where you go, I'll follow
You set the pace, we'll take it fast and slow
I'll follow in your way,
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toe nails for you
I did it just the other day
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Love, love, love, love, love

[Sweet Dream]
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
I want to use you and abuse you
I want to know what's inside you
Movin' on (hold your head up)
Movin' on (keep your head up)
Movin' on (hold your head up)
Movin' on (keep your head up)
Movin' on (hold your head up)
Movin' on (keep your head up)

Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
I'm gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside
Gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside you

[Faded]
You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded

[Heavy Dirty Soul]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean
Gangsters don't cry
Therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist, and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about
Gangsters don't cry
Therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

[Devil Triger]
I'll endure the exile
I'll endure the exile
The darkness of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
This demon inside has ahold of me
Clenching its power, trying to break free
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Move fast baby, don't be slow
Step aside, reload, time to go
I can't seem to control
All this rage that's inside me
Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss
Branded by fire, born in the abyss
Red hot temper, I just can't resist
All this vengeance inside me
All of these thoughts runnin' through my head
Arm on fire, veins burnin' red
Frustration is gettin' bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
Embrace the darkness that's within me
No hiding in the shadows anymore
When this wickedness consumes me
Nothing can save you and there's no way out
I'm a wildfire you won't tame
Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
There's no way to contain
This storm swelling inside me
I'm a bomb you can't defuse
Might just accept you're gonna lose
Can't turn down, I refuse
To hold back anymore
All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
When the night ends, it's not over
We fight through to get closer
Like a silver bullet piercing through
I throw myself into you
All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
